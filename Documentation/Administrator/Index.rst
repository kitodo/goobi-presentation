Installation
************

Composer Mode
=============

It is highly recommended to install this extension by using composer. This is the only supported way.

Please run the following commands in your webroot where the TYPO3 :file:`composer.json` is located:

.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

#. Fetch Kitodo.Presentation with Composer

   .. code-block:: shell

      composer require kitodo/presentation:^3.2

#. Install and Activate the Extension

   .. code-block:: shell

      ./vendor/typo3 extension:activate dlf


Classic Mode
============

However, there are two options to install the required packages solarium/solarium and symfony/event-dispatcher in non-composer mode:

a. Run the command :php:`composer update` within the directory of the extension.
   All required packages are downloaded automatically to the vendor subdirectory.

b. Download the required packages manually to vendor/solarium/solarium and vendor/symfony/event-dispatcher.
   Please check the require sections in :file:`composer.json` of the extension,
   solarium and event-dispatcher to download and install matching versions.

After the installation of the packages in non-composer mode you have to deactivate
and (re-)activate the extension in the extension manager to trigger the TYPO3
autoloader to rebuild the classmap.
